<h2>3. Sequential HERO-ML</h2>

<p>
As mentioned, the sequential part of HERO-ML is a minimum, standard WHILE
language. It is strongly and explicitly typed, and a HERO-ML program
consists of a sequence of type declarations followed by a HERO-ML statement.
In more detail, it has the following features:
</p>

<ul>
  
<li> <b id ="Types">Types</b>: there are simple numerical
  types <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, and a boolean
  type <code>bool</code>. Builtin functions and operators have function
  types on the form <code>t1 -> t2</code>, where <code>t1</code> is the
  argument type and <code>t2</code> is the result type. If the function
  takes several arguments then its argument type is a <i>tuple type</i>
  <code>(t<sub>1</sub>,...,t<sub>n</sub>)</code>. So, for instance, integer addition has the
  function type <code>(int,int) -> int</code>.  However, HERO-ML is not a
  general higher order language.<br>
<b>Type declarations</b> have the format <code>x : t</code>,
where <code>x</code> is a program variable and <code>t</code> is a type.
</li>

<li> <b id = "Operators">Operators and functions</b>: HERO-ML has the
  usual arithmetic operators (<code>+,-,*,/</code>),
  relational operators (<code>=,<</code>),
boolean operators (<code>&&,||</code>), and boolean negation <code>not</code>.
The arithmetic and relational operators are overloaded with respect to the
numerical types, so for instance "<code>+</code>" has both the type
<code>(int,int) -> int</code> and <code>(float,float) -> float</code>.
Implicit type conversion is not permitted: thus, numerical arguments of
different type are not allowed for these operators.
</li>

<li> <b id = "Assignments">"Scalar" assignments</b>: these are
  conventional, sequential assignments. They have the form <code>x =
  e</code>, where <code>x</code> is a variable of simple type
  and <code>e</code> is an expression of the same type.
</li>

<li> <b id = "Control">Control structures</b>: there is a while
  loop <code>while b do s</code>, and a conditional statement <code>if b
  then s else s'</code>, where <code>b</code> is a boolean expression and
  <code>s</code>, <code>s'</code> are statements. (There is also a
  side-effect free if-function, called as <code>if(b,e,e')</code>,
  where <code>e</code>, <code>e'</code> are expressions with the same type.)
</li>

<li> <b id = "IO">I/O</b>: HERO-ML has a simple model for i/o where
  the environment provides an input pipe and an output pipe. The
  statement <code>in t</code>, where <code>t</code> is a type, reads a value
  of type <code>t</code> from the input pipe and <code>out e</code>,
  where <code>e</code> is an expression, evaluates <code>e</code> and writes
  the result to the output pipe.<br>
  
There is no way in HERO-ML itself to tie the pipes to more concrete
  communication channels, such as <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>
  in a unix system. Such associations have to be done in the surrounding
  environment where the HERO-ML program runs.
</li>

</ul>

<b id ="Omitted">Excluded constructs</b>: the current version of
HERO-ML lacks some features found in full programming languages. This
includes user-defined functions and procedures, user-defined types, records,
objects, and pointers. It is possible that some of these features will be
added in future versions of HERO-ML.

<p>
Here is an example of a simple, sequential HERO-ML program:
</p>

<p>
<code>
i : int; x : float:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; i = 1; x = 0.0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; while i < 10 do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = x + in float;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i = i + 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; out x;
</code>
</p>

<p>
This program reads the first ten floating-point numbers from the input pipe,
and writes their sum to the output pipe. This is a purely sequential
program, with no data parallelism. Note that the syntax is
indentation-sensitive, similar to F# and python.
</p>
